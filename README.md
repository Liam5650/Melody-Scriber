# Melody-Scriber

Melody scriber is an experimental application written in python that scans images of piano sheet music and converts them into electronically playable MIDI files, leveraging a variety of computer vision techniques.

In its current state, it is able to achieve playback of some simple melodies when a direct scan of music is used. Future iterations should be robust enough to convert pictures taken from a user's camera for example.

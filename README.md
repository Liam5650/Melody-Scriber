# Melody-Scriber

Melody Scriber is an experimental application written in Python that scans images of piano sheet music and converts them into electronically playable MIDI files, leveraging a variety of computer vision techniques.

In its current state, it is able to achieve playback of some simple melodies when a direct scan of music is used. For example, scanning the image below produces a MIDI file that can be [found here](https://github.com/Liam5650/Melody-Scriber/blob/main/Program%20Working%20Copy/midi_output/output.mid). This file can be downloaded and played back through the MIDI player of your choice.

Future iterations should be robust enough to convert less-clear scans, such as pictures taken from a user's camera.
